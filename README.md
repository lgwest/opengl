# From the course "Graphics with mordern OpenGL"

At www.udemy.com, adapted to linux (Ubuntu 18:04) using cmake, 
instead of using visual studio as don in the course.

## Section 1 Introduction

I skip this on linux
* download glew at sourceforge
* downloads glfw from www.glfw.org

Instead I do 
* sudo apt-get install libglew2.0 libglew-dev
* sudo apt-get install libglfw3 libglfw3-dev

And let cmake find them
